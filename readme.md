## Daily Challenges

This repo supports the challenges mailed daily to this google group:
https://groups.google.com/g/daily-teutulis.

Challenges are generated automatically based on a fixed map for the day, according to a fix tematic (subject of the email).
Participants accrue points based on their inverse position on the challenge of the day (e.g. 1st of 9 gets 9 points), and these points accumulate to a grand prix standing at the end of the week.
On monday participants get points assigned on the championship according their position on the previous week grand prix.
Points assigned follow a F1 distribution: 25 points for 1st place, 18 to 2nd, 15 to 3rd, ....
